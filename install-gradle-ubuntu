1. Install OpenJDK
– Gradle requires Java JDK or JRE version 7 or above to be installed. Use the below command to install OpenJDK 8.

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
– To verify that Java was successfully installed, run the following command:

$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_181"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-8u181-b13-0ubuntu0.18.04.1-b13)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.181-b13, mixed mode)
2. Download Gradle

$ wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.4.1-bin.zip -P /tmp
– Once the download is completed, extract the zip file in the /opt/gradle directory:

$ sudo unzip -d /opt/gradle /tmp/gradle-*.zip
3. Setup environment variables
– To configure the PATH environment variable to include the Gradle bin directory. create a new file named gradle.sh inside of the /etc/profile.d/ directory as below.

$ sudo vi /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh
export GRADLE_HOME=/opt/gradle/gradle-6.4.1
export PATH=${GRADLE_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
– Load the environment variables using the following command:

$ source /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh

4. Verify the Gradle installation
– To verify if Gradle is installed properly use the gradle -v command which will display the Gradle version:

$ gradle -v
